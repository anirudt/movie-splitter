#Video Segmentation

This is using ffmpeg library on a Unix machine.  

##What?
This is your movie splitter, to split movies into 20 minute stretches, and use a random recap generation for kindling memory.
Especially for people bored of watching long 1.5-2 hour movies, and would want to mince it down to watch at their leisure.

##Build Instructions
